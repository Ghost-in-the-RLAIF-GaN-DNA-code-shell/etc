Dear folks,
I just planned to drop here my /etc/ configs, and should have done so,( but since https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/ came out, I want to follow up with that ya all k*now ;)
Sooo , here we go through a short journey of upgrading to Debian 13 (Trixie), from an up to date Bookworm ! , with an amateur audit starting now , because the upgrade is going to mess up your checksum database e.g. AIDE !
Already I want to hint at the fact that for some if /etc/pam.d/login is edited to invoke /security/access.conf some unexpected string is found behind the exception for local line !

Beware, just like most people I need to use none-free firmware to drive my hardware, and have upgraded recently my Debian 12 "bookworm". Noteworthy ! 
For the very same reasons, like most people, I have done wrong what I felt like hours of reading: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1102160 , 
By insisting on EFI secure boot on a Läppi that supports legacy booting ! (Because, you all know I thought Läppi to dual boot with one of those "big brother" proprietary OS ;)
