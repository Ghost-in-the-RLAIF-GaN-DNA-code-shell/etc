Dear folks, I just planned to drop here my /etc/ configs , ( but since https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/ came out, I want to follow up that man with ya all, now ;)
Sooo, here we go trough a short journey of upgrading to Debian 13 (Trixie), from an up to date Bookworm , with an foolish amateur audit, because it is going to mess up ya checksum database e.g. AIDE !
