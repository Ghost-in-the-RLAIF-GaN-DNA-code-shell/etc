Dear folks, I just planned to drop here my /etc/ configs,( but since https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/ came out, I want to follow up with that ya all k*now ;)
Sooo , here we go through a short journey of upgrading to Debian 13 (Trixie), from an up to date Bookworm ! , with an foolish amateur audit later this week ... , 
because it is probably going to mess up ya checksum database e.g. AIDE !

Beware, just like most people I need to use none-free firmware to drive my hardware, and have upgraded recently my Debian 12 "bookworm" !
Noteworthy ! For the very same reasons what I have done wrong after what felt like hours of reading about: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1102160 , 
I insisted on EFI secure boot on a Läppi that supports legacy booting ! (Because, you all know I thought Läppi to dual boot with one of those "big brother" proprietary OS ;)
